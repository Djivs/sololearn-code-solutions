# sololearn-code-solutions

### What is this?





This is archive with all Sololearn problems solutions, including community puzzles, sorted by languages and difficulty.


*All solutions passed official Sololearn tests.*


This repository is not completed yet, so it is normal if you will not find some tasks here. I will

add missing codes soon.





### Which programming languages do you use here?




C, C++, and Python

*As soon as I will learn new language basics, I will add new language solutions.*





### Can I use your code?





Yes, for sure.  But only thing you need to do is mention me as a code creator.





### I found a mistake in your codes!





If that happend, please, let me know! You can do this on GitHub, or you can text me on my email: icemcpe099@gmail.com
